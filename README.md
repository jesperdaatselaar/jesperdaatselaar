### Hi, welcome to my Github profile.

I am **Jesper van Daatselaar**. A Dutch seventeen year old student at the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences where I study Creative Media and Game Technologies.

I am fairly familiar with HTML, CSS, Javascript and frameworks such as bulma or react.

With my profile I hope to give an example of what I can and / or am doing with my Github profile. Documentation will be mostly in English, and most projects will be under the MIT license. A mention is always nice!

Enjoy reading, I'd love to hear from you.
